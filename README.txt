Tile Gen:

What to do:

- Load assets in the "Advanced" or "Base" folder.
- Currently filled with placeholders but can be replaced
- Tiles have the size of 128x128.
- Tiles can not have a border

What Tile Gen does:
- Load all assets and start off with an empty grid
- Clicking on tiles will fill it with a random Tile
- Clicking a tile next to the other tile will only use a fitting tile
- If no fitting tile can be found the tile will turn black
- A generated tile can be clicked again to cycle between all possible tiles
- If there is only one possible tile, nothing will change
